"{TERMINAL_TUTORIAL_1}":"Welcome to the ShiftOS terminal. This is where you will spend the bulk of your time within ShiftOS.
	
A brief rundown of how to use the terminal is as follows. You can use the 'sos.help' command to show a list of all commands. Simply type it in and strike <enter> to view all commands.
	
Commands can be sent arguments by specifying a key-value pair inside a {} block at the end of the command. For example:
	
some.command{print:\"hello\"}
math.add{op1:1,op2:2}
set.value{key:\"somekey\", value:true}
	
You have been given 50 Codepoints - use your knowledge to use them to buy the MUD Fundamentals Shiftorium Upgrade using the terminal.
To buy MUD Fundamentals, type shiftorium.buy{upgrade:\"mud_fundamentals\"} This is also true for any other thing you want to buy from the shiftorium, just replace mud_fundementals with any other upgrade id.

	You can then use them to buy new applications, features, enhancements and upgrades for ShiftOS that make the user experience a lot better. Be careful though, buying too many system enhancements without buying new ways of earning Codepoints first can leave you in the dust and unable to upgrade the system.
